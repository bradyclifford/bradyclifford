Full-stack developer, husband, and father. Enthusiastic about building realistic yet creative front-end applications, and always up for water-skiing when I’m off the computer.

I’m an engineer and entrepreneur committed to continuous personal and professional growth. I love exploring new technologies and applying them to build effective, user-focused solutions.

Outside of work, you’ll find me traveling, hiking, or water-skiing with my family.
